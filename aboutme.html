  <h1> Introduction </h1> 
  <p> I just finished my first year at <a href="http://www.gsb.stanford.edu/"> Stanford Business School </a> and I'm spending the summer interning in <b> Product Management </b> and continuing my journey of learning to code. </br> </br> I'm passionate about internet-enabled <b> products </b> and the impact they can have on their users' lives, and would love to be able to <b> build </b> things on my own. </p>

  <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
  <p> I'm a lifelong learner with an endless curiosity for the way things work and what's important to people around the world. Originally from <b> Palo Alto, California</b>, I grew up surrounded by technology and feel incredibly lucky to have most of my family also living in what I think is the greatest place on the planet both to live and to work. I lived in Singapore for a year which was an incredible experience and I hope to live somewhere in <b>Asia</b> or <b> Australia</b> in the near future. </p>

  <h1>More About Me </h1>
  <h2><b>What are your favorite hobbies?</b></h2>
  <p> My favorite hobbies include traveling (I'm on a quest to visit 50 countries by my 30th birthday- just 17 more to go!), singing (including karaoke!), hiking, wine tasting and anything else that gets me outside in the beautiful California countryside. </p>
  <h2>What's your dream job?</h2> 
  <p>My dream job would be to start my own company. I don't know exactly what the product will be yet, but you can bet it will involve mobile and web interfaces, social ties and helping people to make some aspect of their daily lives at least a little bit better. </p>
  <h2> What music have you been listening to lately?</h2>
  <p> As a singer, I love listening to new artists! I really like <a href= "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6f1yACIoNY" color:magenta> this cover</a> of Boom Clap by Lennon and Maisy- they are sisters, and only 9 and 13 years old! </p>
